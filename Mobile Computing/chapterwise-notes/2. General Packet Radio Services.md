## 🔹 1. What is the difference between **Packet Switching** and **Circuit Switching**?

### 📞 Circuit Switching (Old Phone Calls):

* A **dedicated path** is set up between two users for the whole call.
* No one else can use that path during the call.
* Used in **landline phone systems**.

📌 **Example**: Like reserving a full railway track from Station A to B — no one else can use it until your train is done.

---

### 🌐 Packet Switching (Used in Internet, GPRS):

* Data is broken into **small packets**.
* Each packet **finds its own best path** to reach the destination.
* The packets are **reassembled** at the other end.

📌 **Example**: Like sending your message in 10 separate WhatsApp messages — they may arrive in different order but still make sense in the end.

---

## 🔹 2. What is GPRS?

### 📘 GPRS = General Packet Radio Service

* It’s a **mobile data service** used in **2G and 2.5G GSM networks**.
* Allows users to use internet services like browsing, WhatsApp, or email.
* Data speeds: **56 to 114 kbps**

📌 **Example**: Early mobile internet (before 3G), where you could check emails but video streaming was slow.

## 🔹 3. What are the **Protocols in GPRS System**?

Here’s how data travels in a GPRS network using different protocols (layers of communication):

---

### 📶 Important GPRS Protocols (Simplified):

| Protocol                          | What It Does                                     | Example                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol)** | Moves data between GGSN and SGSN                 | Like a pipe between your phone and internet gateway |
| **SNDCP**                         | Adapts data for different types of networks      | Compresses/optimizes your internet data             |
| **LLC (Logical Link Control)**    | Ensures error-free transmission                  | Retransmits lost or corrupted packets               |
| **BSSGP**                         | Helps route data within the network              | Ensures your data goes to the right tower           |
| **RLC/MAC**                       | Controls how data goes over the air (radio link) | Like a traffic controller for data on mobile towers |

### 📱 Flow Example:

When you open a web page on your 2G phone:

* Your data gets **packetized and tunneled** using GTP.
* It’s adapted for the mobile network via SNDCP.
* LLC ensures reliable delivery.
* BSSGP sends it to the right base station.
* MAC/RLC sends it over the air.

## 🔹 4. How does your mobile **attach or detach** from the GPRS network?

---

### 🔹 GPRS Attach (Login to Network):

Before using GPRS internet:

1. Your mobile **registers** with the SGSN.
2. The network **verifies your identity**.
3. Your info is copied from the **HLR** (Home Location Register).
4. A temporary ID (**P-TMSI**) is assigned to your mobile.
5. Now you are **attached** to GPRS.

📌 **Example**: Like logging into a Wi-Fi network — your device is known and ready.

---

### 🔹 GPRS Detach (Logout from Network):

* You or the network can disconnect the session.
* This is called **GPRS Detach**.

📌 **Example**: Like logging out or turning off mobile data.

---

## 🔹 5. What is **PDP Context Activation**?

### 📘 PDP = Packet Data Protocol

After attachment, your phone still needs an **IP address** to actually use the internet.
This setup process is called **PDP Context Activation**.

---

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Mobile requests IP address** (PDP Address).
2. Network creates a **PDP context** – a record with:

   * IP address
   * Quality of Service (QoS)
   * Access Point info (via GGSN)
3. Now your mobile can **send/receive data packets**.

📌 **Example**: Like getting your **own seat number on a train** — now the network knows exactly how to send data to you.

---

### ❌ PDP Context Deactivation:

* Happens when you **close the internet** or **switch off data**.
* The network **clears the IP and context**.
* No more data can be sent until a new activation.

📌 **Example**: You leave your reserved seat — the ticket is canceled.

## ✅ Final Summary

| Topic                 | In Simple Terms                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Packet Switching**  | Breaks data into packets and sends them on best path   |
| **Circuit Switching** | Sets up a fixed connection for entire call             |
| **GPRS**              | 2.5G internet tech with 56–114 kbps speed              |
| **Protocols**         | Layers like GTP, LLC, SNDCP, MAC/RLC help deliver data |
| **GPRS Attach**       | Mobile logs into GPRS network                          |
| **PDP Context**       | IP address and settings needed to start data transfer  |
