### 🔹 **FCC – Forward Control Channel**

**What it is:**
FCC is a special radio channel used in old mobile networks (like AMPS – Advanced Mobile Phone System).

**Main Purpose:**
It helps your mobile phone **get important messages from the network**, such as:

* "You have an incoming call"
* "You have a new message"
* "Connect to this frequency"

---

### 🔹 **Think of it like this:**

Imagine you're in a hotel, and there's a **loudspeaker (FCC)** in your room. The hotel (mobile network) uses that loudspeaker to:

* Announce if someone is calling you (paging)
* Give general instructions (broadcast messages)
* Ask you to press a button to connect (access message)

---

### 🔹 **Example:**

You switch on your old mobile phone.
The FCC tells your phone:

> “Welcome! You are connected to the network. Stay tuned on this channel. If someone calls, I’ll let you know!”

When someone calls you, FCC sends a signal:

> “Hey phone number 1234, you have an incoming call!”

Your phone hears it, responds, and switches to a voice channel to talk.

## 🔹 1. Standard Distance Vector Routing (DVR)
### 🧠 Think of it as:
> **"Routing by rumor"**

### 🌐 What it does:
- Every router (network device) tells its neighbors how far other destinations are.
- Each router **only knows what its neighbors told it**.
- The path is selected based on **hop count** (how many routers to pass through).

### 🧾 Example:
Imagine you're asking your neighbors how to reach a friend's house:
- One says: “Go 3 blocks and turn left.”
- Another says: “Go 2 blocks and turn right.”

You choose the shortest one (2 blocks).

But nobody really knows if the roads are still open — they’re all guessing based on what others told them.

### ❗ Problem:
- Can lead to **loops** or **slow updates** when paths break.
- It’s like **following outdated or wrong rumors**.

---

## 🔹 2. DSDV – Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector

### 🧠 Think of it as:
> **"Routing by confirmed news with timestamps"**

### 🌐 What it does:
- It still uses distance (like DVR), but adds **sequence numbers** to track freshness.
- Every route update has a **timestamp** or **version number** (called a sequence number).
- **Newer updates always replace older ones**, so no confusion.

### 🧾 Example:
Imagine now you have an app like Google Maps that gives directions:
- It says: “Route to your friend is 2 blocks, updated 10 mins ago.”
- Another says: “Route is 3 blocks, updated 1 min ago.”

Even though it’s longer, you might **trust the newer update** more — because roads might have changed.

DSDV ensures:
- **No loops**.
- **Faster recovery** when a route fails.
- **Better accuracy** in mobile networks (like MANETs).

---

## ✅ Summary Table:

| Feature | Distance Vector (DVR) | DSDV |
|--------|------------------------|------|
| Used In | Wired networks | Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) |
| Routing Info | Hop count only | Hop count + Sequence Number |
| Update Type | Periodic rumor-based | Table updates with timestamps |
| Loop Prevention | No built-in mechanism | Yes (using sequence numbers) |
| Reliability | Less | More reliable and updated |

---

## 📦 Real-World Analogy

| Concept | Analogy |
|--------|---------|
| DVR | Asking friends for directions based on old memories |
| DSDV | Using a GPS app with real-time updates and last update time shown |

## 🔹 a) **Master-Slave Architecture in a Bluetooth Piconet**

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

In Bluetooth, a **piconet** is a small wireless network where:

* **One device is the master** (like the boss)
* **Others are slaves** (like workers)
* The **master controls the timing** and communication
* **Up to 7 slaves** can connect to 1 master

---

### 📱 Example:

Imagine your **laptop** has Bluetooth and is connected to:

* Bluetooth **keyboard**
* Bluetooth **mouse**
* Bluetooth **headphones**
* Bluetooth **printer**

In this case:

* **Laptop** = **Master**
* All others = **Slaves**

The laptop controls when each device can "speak" — like giving turns in a conversation.

### 📘 Notes:

* Devices can **switch roles** if needed (slave becomes master and vice versa)
* If more devices join, it can become a **scatternet** (a network of multiple piconets)

## 🔹 What is MANET?

**MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network)** is a wireless network where devices (like phones, laptops) connect **without any fixed infrastructure** — no routers, no towers.

* Devices move around and form networks on the fly.
* Every device acts like a **router** and helps others send data.

---

## 🔹 a) **Proactive Routing Protocols in MANET**

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

Proactive = **Always ready**
These protocols **always keep the route information updated**, even before it's needed.

> Like **Google Maps always showing you routes**, even if you don’t ask.

---

### ✅ Examples:

### 1. **DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector)**

* Each device keeps a **routing table** with shortest paths to every other device.
* This table is **shared regularly** with nearby devices.
* Based on **Bellman-Ford algorithm**.

📌 **Example**: Your phone knows how to reach every other phone in the area — even if you don’t call them.

---

### 2. **WRP (Wireless Routing Protocol)**

* Also uses a routing table, like DSDV.
* Keeps **more tables** to avoid errors and loops.
* Updates more carefully than DSDV.

📌 **Example**: Like a **post office** that knows all possible delivery routes in advance — and double-checks before sending.

---

## 🔹 b) **Reactive Routing Protocols in MANET**

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

Reactive = **On-demand**
These protocols **find the route only when needed**.

> Like **asking for directions only when you want to go somewhere**.

---

### ✅ Examples:

### 1. **DSR (Dynamic Source Routing)**

* Sender broadcasts a **Route Request (RREQ)**.
* All devices add their name and pass it along.
* The final device sends a **Route Reply (RREP)** back.

📌 **Example**: You ask a crowd: “How to reach John?” Each person adds their name until John replies: “Follow this path!”

---

### 2. **AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector)**

* Also sends RREQ when a path is needed.
* Uses a **routing table only temporarily**.
* Chooses the shortest path and updates it as needed.

📌 **Example**: Like calling out: “Who knows the best way to the bakery?” and using the best answer for the trip.

---

## 🔹 c) **Passive vs Active Attacks in MANET**

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

| Type               | Goal                 | Effect                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Passive Attack** | **Spy silently**     | Steal information           |
| **Active Attack**  | **Break and damage** | Modify, block, or fake data |

---

### ✅ Examples:

### 1. **Passive Attack**

* **Eavesdropping**: A hacker **listens** to your messages silently.
* **Traffic analysis**: Watches which device is talking to which, to learn patterns.

📌 **Real-Life Example**: Someone listening to your phone call **without you knowing**.

---

### 2. **Active Attack**

* **Message modification**: Changes the message (e.g., "Send ₹1000" becomes "Send ₹10,000")
* **Message replay**: Resends old messages to confuse the system.
* **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Blocks your messages or **floods the network** with junk.

📌 **Real-Life Example**: A hacker **intercepts your WhatsApp message**, changes it, and sends it again to the receiver.

## 🔹 a) What is **SUMR** (Satellite User Mapping Register)?

### 📘 In Simple Words:

**SUMR** is like a **tracking register** or **map** used by a satellite system.

* It **keeps track of which satellite is serving which mobile user**.
* It also **stores the positions of all satellites**.

> 🧠 Think of SUMR as a **control room whiteboard**:

* It lists which satellite is connected to which user (like your phone).
* It updates when users move or when satellites move overhead.

---

### 📱 Example:

You’re hiking in the Himalayas using a satellite phone.

* SUMR keeps track of your phone and assigns the nearest satellite to serve you.
* When you move, SUMR updates which satellite should serve you next.

---

## 🔹 b) Satellite System Terms

---

### 1. **Coverage Angle**

### 📘 Meaning:

The **portion of Earth a satellite can see or cover** from its position in space, considering how low it can "look down."

> 📏 It depends on the satellite’s height and how far it can "see" across the Earth’s surface.

---

### 🛰 Example:

A satellite high up in space might see a **large area** — like all of Europe.
But a lower satellite might only cover one country — say, **Germany**.

> Think of standing on a tower — the higher you go, the more area you can see.

---

### 2. **Elevation Angle**

### 📘 Meaning:

This is the **angle between the horizon and the satellite** in the sky from your location.

* It's the "up-down" angle you have to tilt your dish/antenna to **point at the satellite**.
* A **higher elevation angle is better** (less interference, better signal).

---

### 📏 Angle Examples:

| Location | Typical Elevation Angle              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| UK       | 20°–26°                              |
| Europe   | 26°–36°                              |
| Equator  | 90° (satellite is directly overhead) |

> 🧠 If you're in London and want to connect to a satellite, your antenna may need to tilt up at 25° from flat ground.

---

### 3. **Footprint**

### 📘 Meaning:

The **footprint** is the **area on Earth’s surface** that a satellite can cover or reach with its signals.

> It's like the **shadow** or **circle** the satellite "casts" on the Earth.

---

### 🌍 Example:

* One satellite might have a footprint that covers **all of Africa**.
* Another satellite may have a smaller footprint — covering just **India**.

> 🧠 Think of a **flashlight** shining down from the sky — the bright circle on the ground is the footprint.

## 🔹 a) What is a **Satellite Network**?

### 📘 In Easy Words:
A **satellite network** is a communication system where **two stations on Earth** use a **satellite in space** to send and receive data.

---

### 🛰 How it Works:
1. The first Earth station sends a signal **up** to the satellite — this is called **Uplink**.
2. The satellite catches the signal and **re-transmits it down** to the second Earth station — this is called **Downlink**.

> 🧠 Think of it like using a **mirror in the sky** to bounce your voice to someone far away.

---

### 📱 Real-Life Example:
- You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean.
- You call someone using a **satellite phone**.
- The phone sends your voice to a **satellite**, and the satellite sends it down to your friend's phone on land.

---

## 🔹 b) Types of Satellites (Based on Orbits)

Satellites are classified by the **height and path** of their orbits. The orbit decides what job the satellite can do.

---

### 1. 🚀 **Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites**
- **Height**: 160–2,000 km above Earth
- **Speed**: Very fast – circles Earth every **90 minutes**
- **Lifespan**: Short (weeks or months)
- **Use**: Military, spying, satellite internet (e.g., Starlink)

📌 **Example**: A military satellite takes photos of tanks from space.

---

### 2. ☀️ **Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO) Satellites**
- These orbit from **pole to pole** (north to south).
- The orbit is fixed relative to the **sun** — passes over the same place at the same time every day.
- **Use**: Weather satellites and Earth observation

📌 **Example**: Weather satellite captures cloud movement every morning at 10 AM in your city.

---

### 3. 🕒 **Geosynchronous Satellites**
- Orbit time = **24 hours**, same as Earth's rotation
- But **not always above the equator**
- Moves in a **figure-8 pattern** in the sky

📌 **Use**: Good for high-latitude countries like Russia or Canada for communication

---

### 4. 📡 **Geostationary Satellites (GEO)**

3G (especially in UMTS systems) is made up of **two main parts**:

### 1. **User Equipment (UE)**  
This is your **mobile phone**, tablet, or device that uses the 3G network.

### 2. **UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)**  
This is the **network of base stations and controllers** that connects you to the internet or other phones.

---

### 📶 Inside UE and UTRAN: Layers (from bottom to top)

Each device and the network are built on **layers**, where each layer has a specific job. Think of it like a delivery system — each step handles part of the package delivery.

---

### ✅ LAYERS OF 3G NETWORK (Simplified)

| Layer | What It Does | Real-life Example |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **1. Physical Layer (PHY)** | Handles actual radio signals (sending/receiving) | Like your speaker/microphone or antenna |
| **2. MAC (Medium Access Control)** | Manages **who gets to talk and when** | Like a traffic cop allowing only one vehicle at a time |
| **3. RLC (Radio Link Control)** | Splits large messages into pieces, fixes errors | Like slicing a pizza for delivery and checking for missing slices |
| **4. RRC (Radio Resource Control)** | Controls **connections and decisions** | Like a manager deciding who connects, when to switch towers, and what quality is needed |

---

### 🔧 RRC Layer – “The Boss”
- Starts and ends connections.
- Makes sure quality is good.
- Chooses the best tower (cell re-selection).
- Handles **paging** (how the network finds you when you get a call).
- Controls encryption and integrity of messages.

---

### 🔧 RLC Layer – “The Organizer”
- Breaks your data into small parts (segmentation).
- Puts them back together on the other side (reassembly).
- Fixes errors and ensures correct order.
- Detects and removes duplicate data.

---

### 🔧 MAC Layer – “The Traffic Cop”
- Decides **who talks when**, avoiding traffic jams.
- Chooses **transport types** and **handles priorities**.
- Multiplexes data — sends multiple messages together smartly.
- Measures traffic volume.

---

### 🔧 Physical Layer – “The Radio Operator”
- Sends and receives radio waves.
- Encodes and decodes signals.
- Handles timing, synchronization, and modulation (turning data into signal).

---

## 🔹 b) **3G Services**

3G offers **multimedia and high-speed mobile services**, including:

| Service | Description | Example |

## 🔹 2a) **How does CDMA improve system performance compared to FDMA?**

---

### 📘 What is FDMA?

* **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)**:
  Each user gets a **separate frequency channel**.
  Like giving **each person a separate radio station** to talk on.

### 📘 What is CDMA?

* **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**:
  All users **share the same frequency** but use **different codes** to keep their messages separate.
  Like many people speaking at the same time in different **languages** — you understand your own language and ignore the rest.

---

### ✅ Why CDMA is better than FDMA?

| Feature         | FDMA                                 | CDMA                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Frequency usage | Separate frequencies for each user   | All users share the same frequency       |
| Interference    | Needs careful planning (guard bands) | Handles interference better              |
| Capacity        | Limited                              | Higher capacity (can support more users) |
| Flexibility     | Rigid – fixed frequencies            | Flexible – any user can join anytime     |
| Example         | Old radio station                    | WhatsApp group with language filters     |

---

### 🧠 Example:

* In FDMA: If 10 people talk on 10 different channels, each gets 1 channel. No more room after that.
* In CDMA: All 10 people talk on the **same channel**, but in **different languages (codes)** — and they can all hear only their own messages!
