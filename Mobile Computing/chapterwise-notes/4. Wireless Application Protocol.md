## ✅ **What is WAP? Why is it used?**

**WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)** is a **technology** that allows **mobile phones** and **handheld devices** (like PDAs) to **access internet-based services**, such as websites, emails, and online news — even when these devices have **small screens** and **limited memory**.

---

## 📲 **Why was WAP introduced?**

Before WAP came:

* Mobile phones could **only make calls and send SMS**.
* People wanted to use **internet** on phones too.
* But:

  * Phones were **less powerful** than computers.
  * Internet was designed for **PCs** with **big screens** and **fast connections**.
  * Mobile networks were **slow and unreliable**.

### 📉 Challenges WAP solved:

| Challenge                             | Example                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Phones had **slow internet**          | Couldn’t load large websites like YouTube   |
| Phones had **small screens**          | Normal websites didn’t fit well             |
| Phones had **less RAM & CPU**         | Couldn’t handle JavaScript or HTML properly |
| Mobile networks had **low bandwidth** | Loading websites took very long time        |

So WAP was made to:
✅ Simplify web pages
✅ Reduce data size
✅ Make websites mobile-friendly

---

## 🧠 **How WAP works (in simple steps)**

### 📡 Example:

Imagine you are using an **old mobile phone** to open a **news website** like BBC.

1. You type `bbc.com` in your phone browser.
2. Your phone sends the request using **WAP Gateway** (like a translator between phone and internet).
3. The **WAP server** converts the normal HTML site into **WML (Wireless Markup Language)** — a **simpler version of HTML**.
4. Your phone receives a lightweight version of the page.
5. You can now see the **news headlines** on your phone screen!

## ✅ **Summary:**

* **WAP** = Helps phones access the internet in a simple and efficient way.
* It **translates complex websites** into **mobile-friendly** versions.
* It was useful when phones and networks were **slow** and **basic**.
* Used **WML** instead of HTML for **lightweight pages**.

## ✅ 1. What is IEEE 802.11?

**IEEE 802.11** is the **Wi-Fi standard** that defines how **wireless local area networks (WLANs)** work. It allows laptops, phones, and tablets to **connect to the internet wirelessly** using **radio waves**.

---

## 📘 2. Protocol Architecture (Layer-wise Design)

IEEE 802.11 works in **layers**, just like other network models.

### 🧱 Layers in IEEE 802.11:

```
|--------------------------|
| Logical Link Control     |  ← from IEEE 802.2
|--------------------------|
| MAC (Medium Access Ctrl)|
|--------------------------|
| PHY (Physical Layer)     |
|--------------------------|
```

### ✅ PHY (Physical Layer):

* It handles actual **wireless signals**.
* 3 types:

  * **DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)**
  * **FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)**
  * **IR (Infrared Transmission)**

### ✅ MAC (Medium Access Control):

* Controls **when and how devices access** the wireless channel.
* Manages **data collision, retries, acknowledgements**.

### ✅ LLC (Logical Link Control):

* Ensures smooth **communication with higher layers** (like TCP/IP).

+-----------------------------+  
| DSSS | FHSS | IR  (PHY)    |  
+-----------------------------+  
```

---

## ✅ 3. System Architecture of IEEE 802.11

The **system architecture** describes the **devices involved** and how they communicate.

### 📌 Main Components:

1. **STA (Station)** – Any device with a Wi-Fi adapter (laptop, phone, etc.).
2. **AP (Access Point)** – A device (like a Wi-Fi router) that helps STAs connect and pass data.
3. **Portal** – Connects wireless LAN (WLAN) to wired LAN (e.g., office internet).
4. **DS (Distribution System)** – The **backbone network** that connects multiple Access Points.

---

### 🔁 2 Modes of Operation:

#### a) **Ad-Hoc Mode (Peer-to-Peer)**:

* Devices talk **directly** to each other without an AP.
* Temporary, e.g., sharing files between 2 laptops.

#### b) **Infrastructure Mode**:

* Devices connect **via an Access Point**.
* Most common setup in homes, colleges, offices.

---

### 🖼️ System Architecture Diagram:

```
         [Laptop 1]      [Laptop 2]
             |               |
             |   (Wi-Fi)     |
             +------[AP]-----+   ← Basic Service Set (BSS)
                      |
                 [Distribution System]
                      |
             +--------+--------+
             |                 |
         [AP 2]             [Portal]
             |                 |
         [Mobile]         [Wired LAN]
```

* A group of devices + AP = **BSS** (Basic Service Set)
* Multiple BSSs connected via DS = **ESS** (Extended Service Set)

---

### 📗 Example:

Think of your **college Wi-Fi**:

* Your **laptop** is a **station (STA)**.
* The **Wi-Fi router in your classroom** is an **Access Point (AP)**.
* All APs in the building are connected using **Ethernet (DS)**.
* The **college internet server** is connected through a **portal**.

## ✅ Summary:

| Term       | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **STA**    | Any Wi-Fi-enabled device (laptop, phone)   |
| **AP**     | Router that helps devices connect          |
| **BSS**    | A group of STAs + AP                       |
| **ESS**    | Multiple BSSs connected together           |
| **DS**     | Backbone connecting all APs                |
| **Portal** | Bridge between wired and wireless networks |

## ✅ What is an Infrastructure-Based Wireless Network?

An **infrastructure-based wireless network** is the most common form of Wi-Fi network. It uses a **central device called an Access Point (AP)** (like a Wi-Fi router) to let wireless devices (phones, laptops, etc.) connect and communicate — either with each other or with the internet.

---

## 🔧 Main Components of the Architecture:

### 📡 **1. Access Point (AP):**
- It’s like a **traffic controller** for wireless devices.
- Connects wireless users to the **distribution system** (the wired backbone).

### 💻 **2. Wireless Clients (Mobile Nodes or STAs):**
- Devices like laptops, smartphones, tablets.
- Use **wireless LAN adapters** to connect to APs.

### 🔗 **3. Distribution System (DS):**
- A **wired network** that connects **multiple APs**.
- Usually made of **Ethernet cables**, **switches**, and sometimes **fiber optics**.

### 🌐 **4. Internet:**
- The distribution system connects to the **internet** via a switch or router.

---

## 🖼️ Infrastructure-Based Wireless Network Diagram:

```
    Internet
       |
     [Router]
       |
   ---------------
   |             |
[Switch]     [Switch]
   |             |
   |      Distribution System (Wired)
   |             |
[AP 1]        [AP 2]
  / \           / \
[Ph] [L1]     [L2] [Tab]
```

- **AP 1, AP 2** = Access Points (like routers)
- **Ph, L1, L2, Tab** = Phone, Laptop 1, Laptop 2, Tablet
- All devices connect **through APs**, not directly to each other.

---

## 🧠 Example (College Wi-Fi Setup):

Imagine you're in your college:

- You open your laptop and connect to **"Campus_WiFi"**.
- Your laptop connects to the **nearest Access Point (AP)**.
- That AP is connected to the **college switch** using **Ethernet cables**.
- The switch is connected to the **college server or internet**.
- Other students in another block connect to a **different AP** but still access the same network through the **distribution system**.

---

## 🔐 Security in Infrastructure Mode

Because data travels through the air, **privacy and security** are a big concern. That’s why Wi-Fi networks use:

- **WEP, WPA, WPA2** for **encryption**.
- **MAC address filtering** to **allow only known devices**.
- **Firewall and authentication servers** for extra security.

---

## ✅ What is WML?

**WML (Wireless Markup Language)** is a **lightweight version of HTML** used for creating web pages that can be displayed on **early mobile phones and PDAs**.

It was used in **WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)** to show simple web content like **menus, forms, and text** on mobile devices with **small screens** and **limited memory**.

---

## 📱 Why not use HTML?

- Old mobile phones couldn’t handle full HTML (too heavy).
- WML was designed to work on:
  - **Small screens**
  - **Slow connections**
  - **Low processing power**

---

## ⭐ Features of WML (In Easy Language):

| Feature                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Supports Variables**     | You can store temporary data like user name or input                        |
| ✅ **Text Formatting**        | You can make text **bold**, **italic**, or change its size                  |
| ✅ **Supports Images**        | You can display **small icons or logos** (in WBMP format)                  |

## 🧾 Example WML Code:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN"
 "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml">

<wml>
  <card id="home" title="Welcome">
    <p>
      Hello, Student! <br/>
      Choose an option:
    </p>
    <do type="accept" label="Continue">
      <go href="#next"/>
    </do>
  </card>

  <card id="next" title="Form">
    <p>
      Enter your name: <input name="username" />
    </p>
    <do type="accept" label="Submit">
      <go href="#home"/>
    </do>
  </card>
</wml>
```

🔹 In this example:
- We have **2 cards** (like pages).
- One asks for your name.
- One greets you.
- You can **navigate** between cards using **soft buttons**.

---

---

## ✅ Summary:

- WML is like a **mini HTML** made for **old mobile devices**.
- It supports **buttons, text input, navigation**, and more.
- Pages are made of **cards**, and users can **move between them**.
- It helped make mobile web browsing possible **before smartphones**.

---



## ✅ What is WSP?

**WSP** stands for **Wireless Session Protocol**.

It is part of the **WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)** stack and works at the **Session Layer** — just like HTTP does in the regular internet.

You can think of **WSP** as the **mobile version of HTTP** — it's used to:
- Start and manage sessions between the **mobile phone (client)** and **web server**
- Send and receive **web content**, even when the **network is slow or unstable**

---

## 📘 Where does WSP fit in WAP Architecture?

```
+---------------------------+
|     Application Layer     |
|  (WAE - Wireless App Env) |
+---------------------------+
|  WSP (Wireless Session)   |
+---------------------------+
|  WTP (Transaction Layer)  | ← For connection-mode
|  or WDP (Datagram Layer)  | ← For connectionless-mode
+---------------------------+
|    Bearer Network (e.g. SMS, GPRS) |
+---------------------------+
```

---

## 🔧 Services Provided by WSP:

| Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Connection-oriented service** | Works like a **normal internet browser**. Reliable and session-based. Uses **WTP**.     |
| ✅ **Connectionless service**      | Like sending **quick messages** without a full session (like SMS). Uses **WDP**.        |
| ✅ **Session management**         | Keeps the session alive for a long time (even in poor networks).                         |
| ✅ **Push support**               | Server can send data **without the client asking** (e.g., breaking news).               |
| ✅ **Compact HTTP support**       | Supports **HTTP 1.1 features** but with **smaller data size** for slow mobile networks.  |
| ✅ **Feature negotiation**        | Allows phone and server to **agree on what features to use**.                           |

---

## 💤 What is **Session Suspend and Resume** in WSP?

### 🔌 Session Suspend:
- When **network connection drops** or user **pauses browsing**, WSP allows the session to be **suspended temporarily**.
- The session info (like what page you were on) is saved.

### 🔄 Session Resume:
- When the **user reconnects**, WSP **resumes the session** from where it left off.
- No need to reload everything — this **saves data** and improves **user experience**.

### 📱 Example:
You are browsing a **news site** on your phone using WAP.
1. You lose signal in a lift — session is **suspended**.
2. You come back into network range — session is **resumed**.
3. You continue reading the same article without restarting the app or reloading.

|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **WSP**                 | A protocol like **HTTP**, made for **mobile devices**     |
| **Used for**            | Managing sessions between mobile and web servers          |
| **Connection modes**    | Connection-oriented (reliable) & connectionless (fast)    |
| **Suspend/Resume**      | Allows user to pause and resume browsing without losing data |
| **Optimized for**       | **Low-bandwidth** and **high-latency** mobile networks    |


---

## ✅ Q2a) How can we achieve security in WAP applications?

When you browse the web on a mobile phone using **WAP**, your **personal data, passwords, and messages** need to be secure. Just like websites use **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)** for security, WAP uses a special version called **WTLS**.

---

### 🔐 What is WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security)?

- **WTLS** is a secure protocol for **WAP-based mobile communication**.
- It is **based on TLS/SSL**, but is **lighter and faster**, made for **slow mobile networks**.
- It works between the **mobile device** and the **WAP gateway**.

---

### ✅ Key Security Features of WTLS:

| Feature              | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Privacy**       | Keeps data **encrypted** so no one can read it                         |
| ✅ **Data Integrity**| Makes sure data is not **modified** during transfer                     |
| ✅ **Authentication**| Verifies that the **sender is real**                                    |
| ✅ **DoS Protection**| Protects against **Denial of Service attacks** (overloading network)    |

> 🔸 **Non-repudiation is NOT supported** – this means WTLS cannot prove that a message was definitely sent by someone (like a signed legal document).

---

### 🧱 WAP Security Architecture:

```
[Mobile Phone]
     |
  (Encrypted using WTLS)
     |
[WAP Gateway]
     |
 (Re-encrypted using TLS/SSL)
     |
[Web Server (e.g. Gmail, Facebook)]
```

- WAP **Gateway** acts like a **middleman**:
  - It **unwraps** WTLS from the phone.
  - Then **re-wraps** it using normal TLS (SSL) for the internet.

---

### 📱 Example:

You are using your old mobile phone to **check email**:
- Your phone **encrypts your login and message using WTLS**.
- The **WAP Gateway** decrypts it, then **re-encrypts it using TLS** and sends it to Gmail.
- **You never notice this – it happens automatically.**

---

## ✅ Q2b) What are WML Document Modes?

**WML (Wireless Markup Language)** documents are like **HTML pages**, but made for **old mobile phones**.

WML files are written in **XML format** and contain **“decks”** and **“cards”**.

---

### 📘 What is a Deck and Card in WML?

| Term  | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🗂️ **Deck** | A complete WML file (like a mini website). Can have many "cards". |
| 📄 **Card** | A **single screen** or interaction (like a form or message).        |

Just like a deck of playing cards → you flip through each card → each card shows something different (menu, input, etc.)

---

### 📁 Example WML File:

```xml
<wml>
  <card id="home" title="Welcome">
    <p>Welcome to Mobile Site!</p>
    <do type="accept" label="Next">
      <go href="#form"/>
    </do>
  </card>

  <card id="form" title="User Info">
    <p>Enter Name: <input name="username" /></p>
  </card>
</wml>
```

- The **deck** has **two cards**:
  - First card shows welcome message
  - Second card asks for name

---

### 🌐 How WML Documents Are Used:

1. Stored on a **web server** (like HTML pages)
2. Served with MIME type: `text/vnd.wap.wml`
3. When a **mobile user opens a WML URL**, it goes through a **WAP Gateway**
4. The Gateway **converts WML to binary format** (compact and faster)
5. Sent to the mobile phone for display

---

### 🖼️ Diagram: WML Document Access Flow

```
[Mobile Phone Browser]
        |
   Requests WML URL
        |
     (via WAP)
        |
    [WAP Gateway]
        |
 Converts WML to Binary
        |
    [Web Server]
(Hosts .wml deck and cards)
```

---

## ✅ Summary:

### 🛡️ **WAP Security (Part a):**
- Uses **WTLS** for encryption and session security
- Ensures **privacy**, **integrity**, and **authentication**
- Works in a **client → gateway → server** setup

### 📄 **WML Documents (Part b):**
- Made of **decks** (whole file) and **cards** (screens)
- Accessed through WAP Gateway
- Example: A mobile menu or form with simple input

---



## ✅ What is WAP?

## ✅ What is a WAP Gateway?

A **WAP Gateway** is like a **bridge** between a **mobile phone** and the **internet**.

* Mobile phones send requests in **WAP format** (WML, WSP, etc.)
* Most websites on the internet use **HTTP and HTML**
* The WAP Gateway **translates** between these two formats

👉 Think of it like **Google Translate**, but for **mobile internet languages**

---

## 🧠 Real-life Example:

Imagine you're using a **basic phone** to open `https://news.com`.

1. Your phone sends a **WML-based request** via WAP protocols.
2. The **WAP Gateway** receives it and **converts it to an HTTP request**.
3. The website responds with **HTML content**.
4. The **WAP Gateway converts HTML to WML**, optimized for mobile.
5. Your phone shows a small, text-only version of the website.

## 🧱 WAP Protocol Stack (Layers)

Just like the internet has layers (TCP/IP), WAP also has **its own layered protocol stack**:

```
+-----------------------------+
| Application Layer (WAE)     | ← Runs WML apps like browser
+-----------------------------+
| Session Layer (WSP)         | ← Manages sessions like mini HTTP
+-----------------------------+
| Transaction Layer (WTP)     | ← Handles request/response & reliability
+-----------------------------+
| Security Layer (WTLS)       | ← Encrypts data for safety
+-----------------------------+
| Transport Layer (WDP)       | ← Works like UDP
+-----------------------------+
| Bearer Layer (GPRS, SMS...) | ← Actual mobile network
+-----------------------------+
```
