### 🔹 **GLOBAL MOBILE SATELLITE SYSTEMS**


---

### 📡 **Iridium Satellite System – Explained Simply**

The **Iridium Satellite System** is a **global communication network** that uses **satellites** to provide **voice and data services** (like phone calls or internet) **anywhere on Earth**, even in places where normal mobile networks don’t work — like oceans, deserts, or the Arctic.

---

### 🌐 Why is Iridium special?

Most mobile networks (like 4G or 5G) work using **towers on land**. But what happens when you go to:

* A remote mountain
* A ship in the middle of the ocean
* A desert or jungle
* A plane flying over Antarctica

📴 **No towers = No signal**

That's where **Iridium** helps. It covers **100% of Earth** using **66 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites** constantly moving around the globe.

---

### 🚀 Key Features of Iridium:

1. **Global Coverage** – Works from **any location on Earth**.
2. **LEO Satellites** – Satellites are much closer to Earth (\~780 km) than traditional geostationary satellites.
3. **Cross-linked Satellites** – Satellites can talk to each other directly, like passing a message in space.
4. **Used by** – Military, emergency services, shipping, aviation, scientists in remote places.

---

### 📞 Real-life Example:

Imagine you're a **scientist in Antarctica** studying ice samples. There's no mobile network. But with an **Iridium satellite phone**, you can:

* Call your research team in India
* Send weather data via email
* Receive emergency alerts

➡️ **No need for mobile towers** — it connects directly to a satellite above you!

### 🛰️ What is Iridium NEXT?

Iridium is upgrading its satellites with a project called **Iridium NEXT**:

* Improves **speed and quality** of voice and data
* Adds **new services** like Internet of Things (IoT)
* Supports **aircraft tracking**, maritime safety, disaster response

---

### 🧾 Summary for Exams:

* Iridium is a **Mobile Satellite Service (MSS)** that provides **global voice and data** coverage.
* It uses a **LEO satellite constellation** with **cross-linking**.
* Used in **remote, sea, air, and disaster areas**.
* **Iridium NEXT** is the next-gen satellite system for faster, better services.

## ✅ Q2. a) What is SUMR (Satellite User Mapping Register)?

### 🔹 Simple Explanation:

SUMR stands for **Satellite User Mapping Register**.
It’s like a **database** that keeps track of:

* ✅ Which **satellite** is connected to which **user** (mobile station)
* ✅ The **position** of all satellites at any moment

### 🔧 Why is it needed?

Imagine you're using a **satellite phone** while traveling in a desert.
Since satellites are always moving, SUMR helps the system know:

* 📍 Where you are
* 🛰️ Which satellite can best serve your location
* 🔁 When to **switch** you to another satellite (hand-off)

### 💡 Example:

If you’re on a ship in the ocean, SUMR ensures that as one satellite moves out of range, your phone automatically connects to the next satellite — without dropping the call.

---

## ✅ Q2. b) Define the following terms with respect to satellite system:

---

### i) 📐 Coverage Angle

**Definition:**
The **coverage angle** is the **portion of the Earth** that a satellite can see and cover, based on its position in the sky and the minimum required elevation angle.

**Easy way to think about it:**
Imagine shining a flashlight from the satellite toward Earth.
The **area that gets lit up** — that’s the coverage area, and the angle that defines that area is the **coverage angle**.

---

### ii) 🧭 Elevation Angle

**Definition:**
The **elevation angle** is the **up-down angle** between the ground (horizontal) and the satellite in the sky.

**Easy way to understand:**
If you look **straight ahead**, your elevation angle is 0°.
If you look **straight up**, it’s 90°.
Satellites are usually seen in the sky at some angle in between, depending on your location.

**🔻 Minimal Elevation Angle:**
It’s the **minimum angle** required to **maintain a clear signal** with the satellite — below that, buildings, hills, or the Earth itself may block the signal.

---

### iii) 🌍 Footprint

**Definition:**
A **footprint** is the **area on Earth** that a satellite can cover and send signals to.

**Easy example:**
Think of a **satellite’s footprint like a Wi-Fi zone**.
If you’re inside it, you get a signal. If you’re outside, no signal.

Different **transponders** (parts of the satellite) may have different footprints, focusing on specific countries or regions.

| Term                | Meaning (Simple)                                      | Example                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **SUMR**            | Maps user to satellite and tracks satellite positions | Keeps call active while user moves across locations |
| **Coverage Angle**  | How much of Earth a satellite can see                 | Bigger angle = more coverage                        |
| **Elevation Angle** | The up-down angle from ground to satellite            | 90° = directly above, 0° = on the horizon           |
| **Footprint**       | Ground area covered by the satellite’s signal         | India-specific news satellite has Indian footprint  |

## ✅ Q3. a) What do you mean by Satellite Network?

### 🔹 Simple Explanation:

A **satellite network** is a type of communication system where **satellites** help send data between two **Earth stations**.

### 🌐 How it works:

1. **Uplink** – The first Earth station sends a signal **up** to the satellite.
2. **Transponder** – The satellite receives the signal and **amplifies/converts** it.
3. **Downlink** – The satellite sends the signal **down** to the second Earth station.

🛰️ It’s like using a satellite as a **relay station in the sky**.

### 📞 Example:

Imagine you are in a remote island and want to call someone in another country. There’s no mobile tower. But with a **satellite phone**, the call is sent to a satellite and then down to the other person — even across oceans or mountains!

---

## ✅ Q3. b) Briefly explain different types of satellites

Satellites are classified based on the **type of orbit** they follow around Earth. Each orbit has its own use.

---

### 1. 🛰️ **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** Satellites

* **Altitude:** 200–2,000 km above Earth
* **Orbit time:** \~90 minutes per rotation
* **Use:** Military spying, Earth observation
* **Example:** A spy satellite that can see tanks and vehicles clearly from 160 km above.

👉 These satellites are **close to Earth** and move **very fast**, so they cover a different part of the Earth each time.

---

### 2. 🌞 **Sun-Synchronous Orbit** (Polar Orbit)

* **Altitude:** 600–800 km
* **Orbit:** Over Earth's poles, fixed relative to the Sun
* **Use:** Weather forecasting, climate monitoring
* **Example:** A weather satellite that always takes images at the same local time every day.

👉 Great for tracking **weather patterns** and **climate changes** consistently.

---

### 3. 🌍 **Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO)**

* **Altitude:** \~35,786 km above Earth
* **Orbit Time:** Exactly 24 hours (same as Earth’s rotation)
* **Use:** Communication in higher latitudes like Russia or Canada
* **Example:** A Russian satellite that provides TV or internet in far-north areas.

👉 These satellites **appear to hover** over a region for a long time (move in a figure-8 shape).

---

### 4. 📺 **Geostationary Orbit (GEO)**

* **Altitude:** 35,786 km, directly above the **equator**
* **Orbit Time:** 24 hours
* **Use:** TV broadcasting, GPS, internet
* **Example:** A satellite fixed above India continuously broadcasting live TV channels.

👉 Appears **stationary** from Earth – always above the same spot.

---

## ⚙️ Bonus: How satellites are powered

* 🔋 **Solar panels** power most satellites.
* 🚀 Launched by rockets like **Ariane**, **SpaceX Falcon**, or **ISRO PSLV**.
