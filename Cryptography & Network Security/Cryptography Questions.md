# Chapter 5:  INTERNET SECURITY PROTOCOLS, USER AUTHENTICATION

## Short Answer Type Questions

1. **What do you mean by 2-factor authentication?**

   2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires two forms of identification to authenticate a user. This typically involves something you know (password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone).

2. **Describe the functioning of a MAC?**

   A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. It involves a cryptographic hash function combined with a secret key to generate a unique value that is sent along with the message. The receiver uses the same key and hash function to verify that the message has not been altered.

3. **Explain how NAT works with an example.**

   Network Address Translation (NAT) allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing external networks. For example, in a home network, all devices might use private IP addresses like 192.168.1.2, but when accessing the internet, NAT translates these private IPs into a single public IP address.

4. **Differentiate between transport and tunnel modes of operation of IPsec.**

   - **Transport Mode**: Only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the header intact. Typically used for end-to-end communications between hosts.
   - **Tunnel Mode**: Both the payload and header of the IP packet are encrypted. It is used for VPNs to create secure communication between networks.

5. **How is S-HTTP different from SSL?**

   S-HTTP (Secure HTTP) encrypts only the HTTP data, whereas SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) provides a secure connection by encrypting all data between the client and server, including HTTP headers and content.

6. **a) Why is the SSL layer positioned between the application layer and transport?**

   SSL operates between the transport layer and application layer to secure data transmission by providing encryption, authentication, and integrity checks without altering the existing transport and application protocols.

   **b) What are the problems associated with clear text passwords?**

   Clear text passwords are vulnerable to interception during transmission and can be easily compromised by attackers, especially in insecure networks.

7. **What are authentication tokens?**

   Authentication tokens are pieces of data used to authenticate the user, ensuring that the user has valid credentials. These tokens are often used in modern authentication systems such as OAuth.

8. **Name the different Internet security protocols.**

   - SSL/TLS
   - IPsec
   - S/MIME
   - PGP
   - HTTPS
   - Kerberos

9. **What is the purpose of challenges response method in authentication?**

   In a challenge-response authentication method, the server sends a challenge to the client, which responds with an encrypted answer, ensuring that only legitimate users can authenticate.

10. **What is the common way to ensure authentication?**

    Common methods include using passwords, two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, and security tokens.

11. **What are the requirements of authentication?**

    Authentication requires the identification of the user, validation of credentials, and ensuring that the user is authorized to perform the requested action.

12. **What are the goals of password-protected authentication system?**

    The goals are to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and the authenticity of the user's identity while preventing unauthorized access.

## Long Answer Type Questions

1. **Write short note on Biometric Authentication.**

   Biometric authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity based on their physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition. It is considered more secure than traditional passwords as it is difficult to replicate these characteristics.

2. **What do you mean by network security explain with a suitable model.**

   Network security involves measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources in a network. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is often used to illustrate network security, with security measures implemented at various layers including physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers.

3. **a) Why is the SSL layer positioned between Application layer and Transport layer?**

   SSL is positioned here to secure the communication between the client and server without modifying the underlying protocols such as HTTP. It provides encryption, integrity, and authentication, ensuring the confidentiality of data in transit.

   **b) Name the four key steps in the creation of a Digital certificate. How is SHTTP different from SSL?**

   - Key Generation
   - Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Creation
   - Certificate Issuance
   - Certificate Installation

   S-HTTP is designed for encrypting individual HTTP requests and responses, whereas SSL secures an entire communication session between the client and server, including all data sent during that session.

   **c) What are the problems associated with clear text passwords?**

   Clear text passwords are susceptible to being intercepted by attackers during transmission or if the password database is compromised.

4. **a) What are the different sub-protocols defined by SSL? Explain one of them.**

   SSL defines the following sub-protocols:
   - SSL Handshake Protocol
   - SSL Record Protocol
   - SSL Change Cipher Spec Protocol
   - SSL Alert Protocol

   The **Handshake Protocol** is responsible for establishing a secure connection by authenticating the server and client and negotiating encryption methods.

   **b) How can a Digital Certificate be verified?**

   A digital certificate can be verified by checking its signature using the issuer's public key, ensuring the certificate has not been tampered with and is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

5. **Write short notes on the following:**
   - **Kerberos**: A network authentication protocol that uses symmetric key cryptography to provide secure authentication in a client-server model.
   - **Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)**: A standard for securing credit card transactions on the internet, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the transaction.
   - **IPsec**: A suite of protocols used to secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications by encrypting and authenticating data packets between participating devices.

   RFC 822 is a standard for email message formatting, defining the syntax for email headers and body, including fields such as "From," "To," "Subject," etc.

2. **What are the problems with normal SMTP?**

   SMTP is insecure as it does not provide encryption or authentication, making email messages vulnerable to interception and spoofing.

3. **What is MIME?**

   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an extension of the original email format that allows emails to include multimedia content such as images, audio, and attachments.

4. **What is the RFC for MIME?**

   The RFC for MIME is RFC 2045, which defines the standards for encoding and transferring multimedia email content.

9. **What are the key requirements of message digest?**

   A message digest should be:
   - Fixed length
   - Unique (low probability of collisions)
   - Fast to compute
   - Irreversible

10. **Taking p=11, n=19 and assuming values for A and B, find the value of K (symmetric key) by Diffie-Hellman Algorithm and prove that the algorithm is able to maintain security.**

   - Calculating the public keys using the formula \( A = g^a \mod p \) and \( B = g^b \mod p \)
   - Computing the shared secret key \( K = B^a \mod p \) and \( K = A^b \mod p \), where both will result in the same shared key.
