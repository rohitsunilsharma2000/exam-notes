## 🔐{A} **What are the different types of computer security attacks with diagram**

Computer security attacks are deliberate actions aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of computer systems and data. They are broadly classified into two main categories:

---

### 🔍 **1. Passive Attacks**

> Goal: Monitor or steal data **without altering** it.

These attacks focus on **gathering information** without the victim's knowledge.

#### 🔹 a) **Eavesdropping (Sniffing)**

* The attacker intercepts sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails) as it travels across the network.
* Example: Wi-Fi packet sniffing.

#### 🔹 b) **Traffic Analysis**

* Even if data is encrypted, attackers analyze **metadata** (like frequency or timing) to infer information.

> ⚠️ Passive attacks are hard to detect because there's no alteration of data.

---

### ⚔️ **2. Active Attacks**

> Goal: **Alter, damage, or disrupt** systems or data.

Active attacks involve **modifying data**, **injecting malicious code**, or **disrupting services**.

---

### 🔧 **Types of Active Attacks:**

#### 🔹 a) **Masquerade Attack (Impersonation)**

* An attacker pretends to be a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access.
* Example: Logging into a system using someone else's credentials.

#### 🔹 b) **Replay Attack**

* Capturing a valid data transmission and retransmitting it to trick the receiver.
* Example: Resending an old authentication token.

#### 🔹 c) **Modification Attack**

* Unauthorized alteration of a message or data in transit.
* Example: Changing the amount in a bank transfer.

#### 🔹 d) **Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)**

* Flooding a network, server, or website with traffic to make it **unavailable**.
* DDoS uses multiple systems to launch the attack.

#### 🔹 e) **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**

* The attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.
* Example: Intercepting login credentials during a session.

#### 🔹 f) **Malware-Based Attacks**

* Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems.

Types of malware include:

| Malware Type     | Description                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virus**        | Attaches to files and spreads when the file is opened.         |
| **Worm**         | Self-replicates and spreads without user action.               |
| **Trojan Horse** | Appears as legitimate software but performs malicious actions. |
| **Spyware**      | Secretly gathers user information.                             |
| **Ransomware**   | Encrypts user data and demands a ransom to restore access.     |

---

### 🔐 **3. Insider Attacks**

> Performed by users **within the organization**, such as employees.

* **Types:**

  * Disgruntled employees stealing or destroying data.
  * Unintentional breaches (e.g., clicking phishing links).

---

### 🛠️ **4. Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**

#### 🔹 a) **Phishing**

* Deceives users into revealing confidential information via fake emails or websites.

#### 🔹 b) **Spear Phishing**

* A targeted phishing attack aimed at specific individuals.

#### 🔹 c) **Baiting / Pretexting**

* Tricking users through fake promises or fake identities to gain sensitive data.

## 🔍 **b) Explanation of Any Two Attacks in Detail**

---

### **1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**

#### 📌 Definition:

A DoS attack attempts to **make a computer system or network unavailable** to its intended users by **flooding it with traffic** or sending it information that causes it to crash.

#### 📉 Goal:

Disrupt services like websites, email, or servers so legitimate users **cannot access them**.

#### ⚙️ How it works:

* The attacker sends a **huge number of requests** to a server or website.
* The server gets overwhelmed and **stops responding** to legitimate traffic.

#### 🔄 DDoS (Distributed DoS):

* Involves **multiple systems** (often infected devices or botnets) attacking simultaneously.

#### ✅ Example:

A popular e-commerce site becomes **unreachable** during a product launch due to a DDoS attack.

---

### **2. Phishing Attack**

#### 📌 Definition:

Phishing is a type of **social engineering attack** where attackers trick users into revealing **sensitive information** such as usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers.

#### 📉 Goal:

Gain unauthorized access or steal financial and personal data.

#### ⚙️ How it works:

* The attacker sends a **fake email** or creates a **fake website** that mimics a trusted organization.
* The user enters login credentials or sensitive info, thinking it’s legitimate.
* That info is sent to the attacker.

#### ✅ Example:

An email from "your bank" asks you to click a link and verify your account — but the link goes to a **fake site**.

## 🛡️ **a) What are the Principles of Security?**

The core **principles of information security** are often referred to as the **CIA triad**, and can be expanded into **five key principles**:

### 1. **Confidentiality**

> Ensures that sensitive information is accessed **only by authorized individuals**.

* **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.
* **Example:** Password protection, data encryption.

---

### 2. **Integrity**

> Ensures that data is **accurate and unaltered** during storage, transmission, and use.

* **Goal:** Detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Example:** Hashing, digital signatures.

---

### 3. **Availability**

> Ensures that systems, applications, and data are **available when needed**.

* **Goal:** Prevent downtime due to attacks or system failures.
* **Example:** Redundant systems, anti-DDoS protections.

---

### 4. **Authentication**

> Verifies the **identity** of users or systems.

* **Goal:** Ensure that entities are who they claim to be.
* **Example:** Usernames/passwords, biometrics, certificates.

---

### 5. **Non-Repudiation**

> Ensures that a sender **cannot deny** having sent a message or performed an action.

* **Goal:** Provide proof of origin and delivery.
* **Example:** Digital signatures, audit logs.

Set 2: Protocols, Hashing, and Digital Signatures

---

## 🔑 **1. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**

### ✅ a) **Process Description**

The **Diffie-Hellman (DH)** key exchange algorithm, proposed by **Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman**, allows two parties to **securely share a secret key** over an insecure communication channel without actually transmitting the key.

---

### 🔄 **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **Step 1: Agree on Public Parameters**

* Choose a large **prime number** `p` and a **primitive root** (generator) `g` such that:

  $$
  1 < g < p
  $$
* These values `(p, g)` are **public** and known to everyone.

---

#### **Step 2: Private Key Selection**

* **Alice** selects a secret key `a` (private).
* **Bob** selects a secret key `b` (private).

---

#### **Step 3: Public Key Computation**

* Alice computes:

  $$
  A = g^a \mod p
  $$
* Bob computes:

  $$
  B = g^b \mod p
  $$
* `A` and `B` are exchanged over the network.

---

#### **Step 4: Shared Secret Computation**

* Alice computes:

  $$
  S = B^a \mod p = (g^b)^a \mod p
  $$
* Bob computes:

  $$
  S = A^b \mod p = (g^a)^b \mod p
  $$

Since:

$$
(g^a)^b \equiv (g^b)^a \mod p
$$

➡️ **Both get the same secret key** `S`, which is never transmitted.

---

### 🧮 **Example (with small numbers):**

Let:

* `p = 23` (prime), `g = 5` (primitive root)
* Alice chooses `a = 6`, Bob chooses `b = 15`

Compute:

* Alice's public key: `A = 5^6 mod 23 = 8`
* Bob's public key: `B = 5^15 mod 23 = 2`

Exchange:

* Alice receives `B = 2`, computes: `S = 2^6 mod 23 = 64 mod 23 = 18`
* Bob receives `A = 8`, computes: `S = 8^15 mod 23 = 18`

✅ Both share the secret key `18`.

---

## 🔐 b) **Why Diffie-Hellman is Considered Secure**

---

### ✅ **Security Based on Discrete Logarithm Problem**

* Given `g`, `p`, and `A = g^a mod p`, it is **computationally hard** to determine `a`.
* This is known as the **Discrete Logarithm Problem**, which is infeasible to solve for large primes (e.g., 2048-bit).

---

### 🧱 **Security Features:**

| Feature                 | Explanation                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No Key Transmission** | The actual secret key is never sent over the network                     |
| **One-Way Function**    | Easy to compute `g^a mod p`, hard to reverse                             |
| **Ephemeral Support**   | Often used with **temporary keys** to ensure **perfect forward secrecy** |
| **Scalable**            | Used in VPNs, SSL/TLS, SSH, and many secure protocols                    |

---

### ❌ **Potential Vulnerabilities** (if not implemented securely):

| Threat            | Defense                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Use of **digital signatures or certificates** |
| Small primes      | Always use **large primes (2048+ bits)**      |

---

### 🔐 Final Summary:

* **Diffie-Hellman** enables **secure key exchange** over insecure channels.
* Its security comes from the **mathematical hardness** of the discrete log problem.
* It is widely used in **TLS, VPNs, and encrypted messaging**.
