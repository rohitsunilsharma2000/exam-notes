## 🔐 **What are the different types of computer security attacks with diagram**

Computer security attacks are deliberate actions aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of computer systems and data. They are broadly classified into two main categories:

---

### 🔍 **1. Passive Attacks**

> Goal: Monitor or steal data **without altering** it.

These attacks focus on **gathering information** without the victim's knowledge.

#### 🔹 a) **Eavesdropping (Sniffing)**

* The attacker intercepts sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails) as it travels across the network.
* Example: Wi-Fi packet sniffing.

#### 🔹 b) **Traffic Analysis**

* Even if data is encrypted, attackers analyze **metadata** (like frequency or timing) to infer information.

> ⚠️ Passive attacks are hard to detect because there's no alteration of data.

---

### ⚔️ **2. Active Attacks**

> Goal: **Alter, damage, or disrupt** systems or data.

Active attacks involve **modifying data**, **injecting malicious code**, or **disrupting services**.

---

### 🔧 **Types of Active Attacks:**

#### 🔹 a) **Masquerade Attack (Impersonation)**

* An attacker pretends to be a legitimate user to gain unauthorized access.
* Example: Logging into a system using someone else's credentials.

#### 🔹 b) **Replay Attack**

* Capturing a valid data transmission and retransmitting it to trick the receiver.
* Example: Resending an old authentication token.

#### 🔹 c) **Modification Attack**

* Unauthorized alteration of a message or data in transit.
* Example: Changing the amount in a bank transfer.

#### 🔹 d) **Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)**

* Flooding a network, server, or website with traffic to make it **unavailable**.
* DDoS uses multiple systems to launch the attack.

#### 🔹 e) **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**

* The attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties.
* Example: Intercepting login credentials during a session.

#### 🔹 f) **Malware-Based Attacks**

* Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems.

Types of malware include:

| Malware Type     | Description                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virus**        | Attaches to files and spreads when the file is opened.         |
| **Worm**         | Self-replicates and spreads without user action.               |
| **Trojan Horse** | Appears as legitimate software but performs malicious actions. |
| **Spyware**      | Secretly gathers user information.                             |
| **Ransomware**   | Encrypts user data and demands a ransom to restore access.     |

### 🔐 **3. Insider Attacks**

> Performed by users **within the organization**, such as employees.

* **Types:**

  * Disgruntled employees stealing or destroying data.
  * Unintentional breaches (e.g., clicking phishing links).

---

### 🛠️ **4. Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**

#### 🔹 a) **Phishing**

* Deceives users into revealing confidential information via fake emails or websites.

#### 🔹 b) **Spear Phishing**

* A targeted phishing attack aimed at specific individuals.

#### 🔹 c) **Baiting / Pretexting**

* Tricking users through fake promises or fake identities to gain sensitive data.

## ✅ **Summary**

| Category               | Examples                           | Goal                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Passive**            | Eavesdropping, Traffic Analysis    | Steal information silently       |
| **Active**             | DoS, Malware, Modification, Replay | Disrupt, modify, or impersonate  |
| **Insider**            | Employee misuse or leaks           | Damage or data theft from inside |
| **Social Engineering** | Phishing, Pretexting               | Trick users into giving access   |
