### <a name="ans-1"></a>1. Discuss different types of firewalls with neat diagrams.
*Firewalls are crucial security mechanisms used in networks to control and monitor the incoming and outgoing network traffic. Their primary purpose is to establish a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. Firewalls work based on predefined security rules to allow or block traffic. In this explanation, we will cover different types of firewalls along with examples, as well as diagrams, and add tough Bengali (বাংলা) translations for some English words.

### 1. **Packet Filtering Firewall**  
   **(প্যাকেট ফিল্টারিং ফায়ারওয়াল)**

A packet filtering firewall is the simplest type. It inspects network traffic (packets) at a low level based on criteria like source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol type. If the packet meets the rule set, it is allowed; otherwise, it is rejected. This type of firewall does not track the state of connections, meaning it is considered stateless.

**Example:**  
A packet filtering firewall might allow traffic from IP address 192.168.1.100 to port 80 (HTTP), but block all other incoming connections.

**Diagram:**
```
  +---------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network      |
  |     (Internal Network)     |
  +------------+--------------+
               |
               |  Packet Filtering
               |  Firewall
               |
  +------------+--------------+
  |     Untrusted Network     |
  |       (External Internet) |
  +---------------------------+
```

### 2. **Stateful Inspection Firewall**  
   **(স্টেটফুল ইনস্পেকশন ফায়ারওয়াল)**

Stateful inspection firewalls are more advanced than packet filtering firewalls. They not only check the header information but also track the state of active connections (connection states). The firewall keeps track of the session between the client and server and ensures the packets are part of an ongoing, valid connection.

**Example:**  
If a user establishes a connection from an internal system to an external server, the firewall remembers the connection's state. If the server tries to send unsolicited data (e.g., an unexpected packet), the firewall will block it.

**Diagram:**
```
  +----------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network      |
  |     (Internal Network)     |
  +-------------+--------------+
                |
                |  Stateful Inspection
                |  Firewall
                |
  +-------------+--------------+
  |      Untrusted Network     |
  |        (External Internet) |
  +----------------------------+
```

### 3. **Proxy Firewall**  
   **(প্রোক্সি ফায়ারওয়াল)**

A proxy firewall acts as an intermediary between the internal network and external networks. It receives requests from clients, forwards them to the destination server, and then relays the response back to the client. This type of firewall hides the internal network's real IP addresses and provides an additional layer of security by preventing direct access to internal systems.

**Example:**  
A proxy firewall might intercept a user's request to visit a website. Instead of allowing the client to connect directly to the website, the firewall forwards the request and sends back the response, ensuring that the internal network remains secure.

**Diagram:**
```
  +-----------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network       |
  |     (Internal Network)      |
  +------------+----------------+
               |
               |   Proxy Firewall
               |   (Intermediary)
               |
  +------------+----------------+
  |    Untrusted Network        |
  |   (External Internet)       |
  +-----------------------------+
```

### 4. **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**  
   **(নেক্সট-জেনারেশন ফায়ারওয়াল)**

Next-Generation Firewalls combine traditional firewall capabilities with additional features such as deep packet inspection (DPI), application awareness, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and cloud-delivered threat intelligence. NGFWs are designed to address modern threats, such as malware and advanced persistent threats (APT). They provide more granular control over network traffic.

**Example:**  
An NGFW can detect and block specific applications like social media or file-sharing apps and can also identify encrypted traffic that may contain malware.

**Diagram:**
```
  +-----------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network       |
  |     (Internal Network)      |
  +-------------+---------------+
                |
                |  Next-Generation
                |    Firewall (NGFW)
                |
  +-------------+---------------+
  |      Untrusted Network      |
  |        (External Internet)  |
  +-----------------------------+
```

### 5. **Application Layer Firewall**  
   **(অ্যাপ্লিকেশন লেয়ার ফায়ারওয়াল)**

An application layer firewall (also known as a Layer 7 firewall) operates at the application layer of the OSI model. This firewall inspects traffic for specific applications and protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS). Unlike other firewalls, which filter based on network information (IP addresses, ports), application layer firewalls analyze the data being sent and can block harmful payloads in specific applications.

**Example:**  
An application layer firewall might block an HTTP request that attempts to exploit a vulnerability in a web application (e.g., SQL injection or cross-site scripting).

**Diagram:**
```
  +------------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network        |
  |     (Internal Network)       |
  +-------------+----------------+
                |
                | Application Layer
                | Firewall
                |
  +-------------+----------------+
  |      Untrusted Network       |
  |        (External Internet)   |
  +------------------------------+
```

### 6. **Hybrid Firewall**  
   **(হাইব্রিড ফায়ারওয়াল)**

A hybrid firewall combines the features of different types of firewalls, typically integrating stateful inspection with deep packet inspection (DPI) and sometimes including proxy functions. Hybrid firewalls are versatile and provide enhanced security by offering multiple layers of defense.

**Example:**  
A hybrid firewall might combine the session tracking of a stateful inspection firewall with the application awareness of an NGFW, providing comprehensive protection against a wide range of network threats.

**Diagram:**
```
  +-----------------------------+
  |       Trusted Network       |
  |     (Internal Network)      |
  +-------------+---------------+
                |
                |  Hybrid Firewall
                |
  +-------------+---------------+
  |    Untrusted Network        |
  |   (External Internet)       |
  +-----------------------------+
```
