## 2. Short Answer Type Questions

### 2.1 Discuss different types of firewalls with neat diagrams

(Provide an explanation of different types of firewalls, such as Packet Filtering Firewall, Stateful Inspection Firewall, Proxy Firewall, and Application Layer Firewall. Include diagrams where applicable.)

### 2.2 What is the difference between an application and network layer firewall?

(Application layer firewalls filter traffic based on application-level data, while network layer firewalls inspect traffic based on lower-level IP protocols.)

### 2.3 What do you mean by trusted service and trusted devices in firewall configuration?

(Trusted services are network services considered safe for communication in a firewall setup, while trusted devices are those authenticated and authorized to access the network.)

### 2.4 Differentiate between Packet filters and Application Gateways

(Packet filters work at the network layer and inspect headers, while application gateways filter traffic based on the actual application data and provide more robust security.)

## 3. Long Answer Type Questions

### 3.1 What is a firewall? What are the different types of firewalls? State the limitations of a firewall.

(A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Types of firewalls include packet filtering firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, proxy firewalls, and application firewalls. Limitations include the inability to detect internal threats, reliance on proper configuration, and the potential for performance bottlenecks.)

### 3.2 Write short notes on the following: 
#### a) Application firewalls

(Application firewalls filter traffic at the application layer and are specifically designed to block traffic based on the specific applications, protocols, or services.)

### 3.3 Write short notes on DMZ

(DMZ stands for Demilitarized Zone and is a network area that separates an internal network from untrusted external networks, providing an additional layer of security.)

### 3.4 Write short notes on Packet Filtering

(Packet filtering is the process of controlling network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing or blocking them based on a set of predefined rules.)
